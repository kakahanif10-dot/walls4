        <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted">
          Each input is normalised to a 0–100 scale and combined with fixed weights. Weights changed
          only once since inception; every change is logged for Institutional subscribers. Momentum
          carries the largest weight because it leads price, while the 200-day relationship is treated
          as a regime filter rather than a signal.

        <h2 className="mt-12 font-display text-2xl text-bone">3. Conviction, risk and sizing</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted">
          Conviction scales with the distance of the score from neutral and with position in the
          52-week range; it never implies certainty. Risk grade is derived from 60-day realised
          volatility and drives position sizing guidance. A high-volatility asset receives a
          proportionally smaller notional for the same risk contribution — that is the entire point of
          grading it.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-12 font-display text-2xl text-bone">4. Where the data comes from</h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted">
          Quotes and daily closes are fetched server-side from public market endpoints
          (<strong className="text-bone/90">Nasdaq</strong> for US equities and
          <strong className="text-bone/90"> OKX</strong> for crypto and meme coins, with CoinGecko as a
          fallback for digital assets). Index prices refresh about once a minute; equity quotes are
          <strong className="text-bone/90"> delayed</strong>, and outside US trading hours they show the
          last close. The feed badge on the tape names the source and whether the tape is delayed.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted">
          Nothing on the site is generated: the chart, the 52-week range, realised volatility, the
          moving averages and the trend score are all computed from real daily closes. When a source is
          unreachable the site falls back to the last real value it received and says so, rather than
          inventing a price. The trend score is an output of the published scoring model, never a
          prediction, and none of it is investment advice. Displaying third-party quotes publicly
          requires a licence or agreement that allows redistribution, and a commercial provider plan is
          required before this becomes a paid data product.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-12 font-display text-2xl text-bone">5. Risk disclosure</h2>
        <div className="mt-3 space-y-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted">
          <p>
            NextWall Street publishes market analysis and educational material only. Nothing on this
            site constitutes investment advice, a personal recommendation, a solicitation, or an offer
            to buy or sell any security, token, derivative or other financial instrument. We do not
            manage client money, we do not execute orders, and we hold no positions in the assets we
            cover.
          </p>
          <p>
            Investing and trading involve a substantial risk of loss, up to and including the total
            loss of capital. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Speculative assets, including
            meme coins and small-cap tokens, can lose their entire value and may be subject to
            liquidity constraints, custody risk or fraud. Past performance does not predict future
            results, and no model — including ours — has a guaranteed edge.
